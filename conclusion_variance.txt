Conclusion:
The runtime measurements for the convex hull algorithms are nearly 
independent of the range or variance of the point cloud. Changing the 
coordinate bounds from [0,1] to [-5,5] does not significantly affect the 
computational time. This is because the algorithms' time complexities 
depend on the number of points rather than the absolute values of the 
coordinates.
