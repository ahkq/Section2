Conclusion:
The measured runtimes indicate that while all convex hull algorithms scale 
with the number of points, their constant factors and scaling behavior 
differ. For small n, differences are minimal; for large n, algorithms 
like Quickhull and Monotone Chain tend to be faster than Jarvis March, 
with Graham Scan performance dominated by the initial sorting step. These 
observations are consistent with the theoretical time complexities.
