Conclusion:
The convex hull algorithms' runtime scales primarily with the number of 
points and appears largely independent of the variance of the point cloud. 
In our tests using a Gaussian distribution (variance=1), the measured 
runtimes reflect the algorithms' inherent time complexities rather than 
the spread of the data.
